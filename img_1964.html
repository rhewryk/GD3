	<p id="p_1964">This cornerstone is not very legible which is due to the stone that was used. The text reads "A.D. 1964" and there is a large cross on the left side of the stone. The text has one width that sometimes is thinner such as the bar in the capital A. If you were to flip your screen or look upside down the numbers 9 and 6 are not flipped and mirrored versions of each other. The number 6 has a terminal that is more curved at the top when compared to the number 9.</p>
