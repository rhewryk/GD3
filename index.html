	<h1>CORNERSTONES</h1>

	</head>
	<body>
		<p>The placement of a stone on a building is a practice that dates back to Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Though the significance of this has changed throughout history, the main ideas and reasons for this is still relavant today. In Ancient Egypt, there were ceremonies whose purpose was to be performed during the placement of the cornerstone. As such, this tradition used to be more religious as it made sure that the gods would protect the building. In today's society, the placement of a corerstone can have religious meaning while there are instances where there is little to no association with religion. Additionally there were offerings placed infront of the stone for spiritual purposes. Today, there are still occassions when offerings are placed infront of the cornerstones in certain places. The importance of the religious meaning and ceremonies that accompanied this tradition have greatly decreased.</p>


	<div class="background_text">
		<p>The images on this page are in chronological order with the oldest cornerstone being from the year 1978 which can be found on the top right side of this page. From there, each row from left to right has stones whose dates follow the first one. The last cornerstone is from the year 1991. By clicking on any image, you are taken to a page with that image on a larger scale. There is some additional text to support the image and further explain and describe it. On the right-hand side of each image there are coordinate points. By clicking on these coordinate points, you are then re-directed to the bottom of the main page where there is a map and dots of all the coordinate places for each image included on the site. </p>

<!-- 
		Statement 
			-I'm interested in cornerstones. Using typography and images of cornerstones I will showcase these in chronological order with contextual information in additon to historical background on the subject.

notes on the history of cornerstones
	-in architecture, it is the first stone laid for a structure along with the foundation
	-all preceding stones are placed in reference to it
	-important as it signifies the direction (geographically) of the building along with it's entrance (which way it's facing etc)
	-Mesopotamian and Ancient Egyptian cultures had a ceremony similar to this but it was more focused on blessing the building and making sure that the gods protect it
	-historically cornerstones were significant as they permitted the gods to protect the structure
	-there were religious ceremonies performed with the placing of the stone with offerings placed infront
	-the text on the stone usually indicates the date of completion of the structure or dates of construction (sometimes reconstruction) in addition to the names of the builder, architect as well as other individuals who had a significant impact on the building
	-the placing of a cornerstone when building was and to a certain extent still is culturally important to eastern architecture
	-freemansonry: 
		-freemasons performed public ceremonies of cornerstone laying for notable buildings
	-contemporary:
		-in today's society, if there is a ceremony taking place to officially open a building or such a person of some significance or status (most-likely) will conduct it
		-until the 1970s and sometimes still today, the ceremonies involved a trowel that was manufactured for this purpose
		-the trowel had a formal purpose in laying the mortar under the stone
		-additionally a speacial hammer was also used during the ceremony to tap the stone into place
		-commonly this cornerstone (sometimes called the foundation stone) has a cavity that consists of a time capsule - it can contain newspapers of the day/week of the ceremony as well as other artifacts typical of that year-coins etc)
	-more history:
		-when George Washington presided over the laying of the first stone for the United States Capital Building is one of the earliest cornerstone ceremonies in the United States
		-Masons of America had created a ceremony for laying a cornerstone at the time of the Capital Building's ceremony; corn, wine and oil were placed on the stone
	-cornerstones are able to preserve time as buildings that are marked with a date of when it was constructed
	-today:
		-cornerstones are usually placed as ornaments in the floor, the faÃ§ade of a building, in interior walls depending on the preservation and inscription
		-the purpose of laying a cornerstone today is mostly for the publicity that surrounds the ceremony
