	-important as it signifies the direction (geographically) of the building along with it's entrance (which way it's facing etc)
	-Mesopotamian and Ancient Egyptian cultures had a ceremony similar to this but it was more focused on blessing the building and making sure that the gods protect it
	-historically cornerstones were significant as they permitted the gods to protect the structure
	-there were religious ceremonies performed with the placing of the stone with offerings placed infront
	-the text on the stone usually indicates the date of completion of the structure or dates of construction (sometimes reconstruction) in addition to the names of the builder, architect as well as other individuals who had a significant impact on the building
	-the placing of a cornerstone when building was and to a certain extent still is culturally important to eastern architecture
	-freemansonry:
		-freemasons performed public ceremonies of cornerstone laying for notable buildings
	-contemporary:
		-in today's society, if there is a ceremony taking place to officially open a building or such a person of some significance or status (most-likely) will conduct it
		-until the 1970s and sometimes still today, the ceremonies involved a trowel that was manufactured for this purpose
		-the trowel had a formal purpose in laying the mortar under the stone
