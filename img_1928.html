	<p id="p_1928">This cornerstone is located on the side of a Synagogue. There is a range of years which are written in Old Style type. This can be inferred from how the number 9 is very low on the baseline when compared to the number 8. The simplicity of this cornerstone is what makes it stands out. The numbers are ever so slightly serifed as opposed to previous numbers that had heavy serifs.</p>
