	<p id="p_1976">This cornerstone is from the year 1976 and is located on the side of a church. The two letters in the top left are in Cyrillic and their translation to English would be "AD" similarly to other cornerstones. The underlying grid present on this cornerstone enables the completed work to be very cohesive and the differentiations in size do not hurt the eyes.</p>
