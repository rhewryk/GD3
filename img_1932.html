	<p id="p_1932">As the placement of this cornerstone is clearly written on it, this cornerstone is located at Rockefeller Center in New York City. It is from the year 1932. The Center was built in the middle of the Great Depression but this was made possible as people who were unemployed made up the majority of the workforce that built this building. Contrasting to the previous cornerstones mentioned, the text on this one is overlaid with a gold leaf. This makes it stand out and legible from further away.</p>
