	<p id="p_1789">This first cornerstone is the oldest of the ones on this site. It commemorates when the First President Of The United States took the Oath. This was George Washington on April 30, 1789. While the stone has become worn with time, the text is not only legible but you can makeout the slight serifs and stylistic elements of the type.</p>
