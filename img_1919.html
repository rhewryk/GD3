	<p id="p_1919">Unlike previous cornerstone, this text is on three stones that are placed on top of each other. The text is relatively straight-forward with no unnecessary embellishments. The text is serifed with the only main difference between the hiearchy of three texts being size. The main text is fully justified in an excellent manner as no lines stand out as being too crowded or spacious.</p>
