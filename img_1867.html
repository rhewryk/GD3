	<p id="p_1867">This second cornerstone is from the year 1867. It is on the side of a church which can be inferred from the cross that is in the middle of the year. Although it is difficult to make out the 67 on the right side of the stone, the numbers can be classified as old style. The cross was carved in very deep into the stone which contrasts with the lightness of the date.</p>
