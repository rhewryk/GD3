	<p id="p_1991">This cornerstone has text in two different scripts as well as numbers. The script at the top is Cyrillic and to be more specific, the text is in Ukrainian. There is a cross diving the top text from the bottom. The text is not completetly serif as there are instances such as the capital N that doesn't have any serifs, and yet the capital E has serifs. The date at the bottom is sans-serif and is able to work well with both scripts.</p>
