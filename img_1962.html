	<p id="p_1962">This cornerstone was found on the University of Toronto Downtown Campus. The text is centered with the date being at the very bottom. The text has wedge-shaped serifs and there is not a large variation of stroke width. When looking closely at the bottom at the date, the number 2 is written twice and both times appears to be leaning forward. This is due to the fact that the bottom bar is too short in the front. The wedge-shaped serifs can be seen in the numbers as well which creates a cohesive composition present on this cornerstone.</p>
