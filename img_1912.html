	<p id="p_1912">This cornerstone is unlike anything previous stones mentioned. It has AD written above the range of dates. The style of text is closer to something from the 17th century or earlier. When looking at the individual numbers, the 2 is very curved and has its own personality. The number 1 is also stylistic to a certain extent as the top and bottom have slight splits. Inbetween the dates and the letters at the top, there are very lightly added small crosses that can appear to be dots from further away. </p>
