	<p id="p_1966">It can be easily identified that this cornerstone is not in English using latin letters but is using the same numbers. The date on this cornerstone is 1966 and as previously mentioned, if you were to flip your screen or look upside down, the numbers 6 and 9 and flipped and mirrored versions of each other. The text is sans-serif with pronounced variation of stoke weight. This can be easily seen in the number 9 and 6. The additional ornamentation inbetween and below the text adds a feature that isn't that common among cornerstones.</p>
