	<p id="p_1927">The text on this cornerstone is Blackletter. For the year 1927, Blackletter was not the style of type being used. The decision to design using Blackletter type is unique. When comparing this with a cornerstone from the time period blackletter was being widely used, it is hard to tell any difference and yet they are centuries apart. This is also ironic as there is a date and yet the style in which this was executed is deciving. </p>
