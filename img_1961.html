	<p id="p_1961">This very symmetrical cornerstone is from the year 1961. The text is sans-serif as the number 1 is a straight vertical line. There is an aspect to this stone that has been mentioned in others and that is if you flip your screen or look upside down, the 9 and 6 and flipped and mirrored versions of each other. As the 9 and 6 do not fully close, the cornerstone appears more balanced as the white space is constantly present throughout.</p>
