	<p id="p_1884">While cornerstones usually have the year of completion of a building, sometimes there is a range of years recorded. In this cornerstone from St. James Church in Manhattan, NY the rage of years starts from 1810 and ends at 1884. Overall this span of time is quite large. The text appears to be written in a more traditional Irish-style way.</p>
