	<p id="p_1940">The serif text on this cornerstone has four crosses in each corner of the stone. The text is in the centre of them and fully justified to best that is possible. As such, the first line is not tracked out as that would not look pleasing to the eyes. The date at the bottom is slightly tracked out which makes it more legible.</p>
